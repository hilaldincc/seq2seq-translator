# seq2seq-translator

This project is a basic Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) translation model implemented in Python.  
It uses an Encoder-Decoder architecture with LSTM layers to translate text from one language to another.

## âœ¨ Features

- Encoderâ€“Decoder architecture  
- LSTM-based translation model  
- Simple text preprocessing  
- Prediction capability after training
